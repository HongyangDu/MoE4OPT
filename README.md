> **"Mixture of Experts for Network Optimization: A Large Language Model-enabled Approach" [Download Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09756.pdf)**


Network optimization strategies. *Part A* demonstrates the drawbacks of training distinct AI models for different user requirements, emphasizing the costs of excessive AI model deployment. *Part B* presents our LLM-enabled MoE approach, using a limited set of DRL models to efficiently address a variety of user tasks.

The problem we solve: *How can we achieve effective network optimization without using numerous DRL models individually trained for each specific task?*

## üîß Environment Setup

To create a new conda environment, execute the following command:

```bash
conda create --name moeopt python==3.7
```
## ‚ö°Activate Environment

Activate the created environment with:

```bash
conda activate moeopt
```

## üì¶ Install Required Packages

The following packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30
pip install scipy
pip install torchvision
pip install scikit-image
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run the Program

Run `main.py` to start the program.


## üîç Case Study 1: Maze Navigation Task
LLM-enabled MoE framework demonstration in a maze navigation task. An ensemble of DRL models trained on diverse tasks serves as a set of
expert models accessible to the LLM. The LLM analyzes and infers user tasks, leveraging combinations of expert models to address the final objectives.
